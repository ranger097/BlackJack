#BlackJack

Working on a game called Legendary Blackjack.

It's normal blackjack, but getting 21 is only half of it.

The objective is to go "Legendary Mode."

Different events will happen that up the risk of the game.

The risk sometimes will be 50/50 or 1/10, but it's randomized for the most part.

The risk level will be tracked, and you will have the option to gain so much or start all the way over.

Very high highs if you pull it off, though.

The game is far from finished but will be very fun and enjoyable when it's done.

Example: The girl you like just sat at the table; you're at 19, and the dealer is at 18.

You are already winning, so there is no point in taking a hit.

Anyway, when prompted, you choose to anyway. You get the 2 of hearts.

Incredible!

Your legend status goes up.

She tells you she has never played.

When prompted, you either tell her you aren't interested in teaching or that you can help, and she will ask questions, and you can respond.

OR? You can pass her $1k and tell her to hit no matter what.

So risky, so ballsy. In-game, I'd give you a 1/4 chance of it working, just so it's tempting.

The risky situations make your legend status go up, and you will get big rewards.

Okay, so a lot needs to be added and done to get this game working.

Including the story scripts. I need a lot of different stories and situations so the game isn't super repetitive.

If you have good suggestions or tips, just send them. AI is good for some of the stories and situations, but I'm kind of against using AI for this project. 

Hence the comments so others can learn when we are done.

Once we are done i encourage others to mess with the code and make it there own game to better learn as we are doing.

Or just play for fun. idc either way.
